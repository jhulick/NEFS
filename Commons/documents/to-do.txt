* Add JMX MBean support in the core library that other derived classes can build upon (like http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/modeler.html).
* Integrate with AppStats Framework (http://appstats.sourceforge.net/). The Metrics and SqlExectionLog in Axiom may be replaced by or built upon this library.
* Add an exception notification facility similar to http://sijpkes.20m.com/jexn/.
* Consider adding isJmx() methods as a RuntimeEnvironment option to indicate when runtime is under JMX.
* Add ability to retrieve environment variables for configuration properties (use Ant example).
* Create Ant task that will allow the running of Metrics generator and store results in a configurable file name (for scripting the execution of metrics).
* Add basic User Management functionality to the Access Control framework. Use Realm design pattern (http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-4.0-doc/config/realm.html) and find a way to use the HttpServletRequest.getUserPrincipal() and HttpServletRequest.isUserInRole() methods.
* Consider integration with MARS network monitor (http://www.altara.org/mars.html).
