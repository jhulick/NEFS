    <title>Methods of Evaluating NEFS</title>

    <para>The <emphasis>quickest</emphasis> way to evaluate the NEFS is to
    view all the documentation online and follow along with the online
    versions of the sample applications. Since all you need is a web browser,
    you can start learning about NEFS immediately. Because the applications
    are online, you will also be introduced to NEF's built-in remote
    development and team programming capabilities by seeing for yourself how
    you can review code and applications remotely. The sole disadvantage of
    the online evaluation is that you will not have the ability to dabble in
    or change the application code yourself.</para>

    <para>The <emphasis>recommended</emphasis> method of evaluating the NEF is
    to download sample applications and install them in your own application
    server. Each of the downloadable sample applications are provided as
    app-server-independent <filename>.war</filename> files. Each sample app's
    <filename>.war</filename> file contains everything you need, including all
    of the NEFS binaries, third-party libraries, and resources, to start using
    NEFS immediately. Once you have downloaded any <filename>.war</filename>
    file from our website, you have everything you need to start modifying and
    adding to the app. There is even a special sample application called the
    <emphasis>NEFS Starter</emphasis> that allows you to start writing your
    own applications using an empty template app.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Sampling the NEFS Online</title>

    <para>The <emphasis>Enterprise Sampler</emphasis> application, available
    at <ulink
    url="http://www.netspective.com">http://www.netspective.com</ulink> (by
    clicking the <emphasis>Try Online</emphasis> link), is the first NEFS
    sample application that you should try because it's designed to help
    sample important components of the presentation and user interfaces
    features of our Frameworks. The application contains complete instructions
    on what's available to sample and links to important features.</para>

      <graphic fileref="./resources/images/screen-sampler-home.gif" />
    </screenshot>

    <section>
      <title>Running the Sample Applications Online</title>

      <para>All of the NEFS sample application are available at <ulink
      url="http://www.netspective.com">http://www.netspective.com</ulink> (by
      clicking the <emphasis>Try It Online</emphasis> link from the Home
      page). Each of the sample applications have two links: one is a link to
      the application itself and the other is a link to it's
      <emphasis>Console</emphasis> Servlet.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Viewing XML Source Code in the Sampler</title>

      <para>The NEFS uses simple XML tags as its object construction and
      declaration language. The <emphasis>Enterprise Sampler</emphasis>
      application provides links on every page that allow you to learn how a
      few simple lines of XML can produce sophisticated web based
      applications.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Viewing Other Source Code and Application Files in a
      Browser</title>

      <para>The Netspective administration console, called the
      <emphasis>Enterprise Console</emphasis>, provides a complete file
      browser with color syntax highlighting for XML, JSP, Java, JavaScript,
      and SQL files – this file browser allows you to review source code for
      online sample applications or locally if you downloaded the sample
      applications.</para>

      <para>The Enterprise Console is a special Sparx Servlet that provides a
      browser-based administrative interface to all of the dynamic components
      and objects that NEFS produces. The Enterprise Console is automatically
      available to all NEF-based applications during development and each NEFS
      application has a private instance of the Console available at
      <literal>http://[server]/[appName]</literal><emphasis
      role="bold"><literal>/console</literal></emphasis>. When you log into
      the Console for Application X (.../appX/console) versus Y
      (.../appY/console) you will only see components for the appropriate
      application.</para>

      <important>
        <para>Each sample app features its own Console Servlet and the default
        login user name is '<literal>console</literal>' and the default login
        password is '<literal>console</literal>'.</para>
      </important>

      <screenshot>
        <graphic fileref="./resources/images/screen-console-login.gif" />
      </screenshot>

      <para>Once you have logged into the Console for any particular
      application, all of the source files and folders are available for
      viewing. Simply click on the <guimenuitem>Project</guimenuitem> tab and
      then click <guimenuitem>Project Folders</guimenuitem> to view all of the
      folders contained in the application and <guimenuitem>Project
      Files</guimenuitem> to navigate all the directories and look at the
      project files. The first time you enter the Project Files section, you
      should see a list of all the directories that exist in the application’s
      root directory. You can click on any directory to navigate to it and
      view the list of files and sub-directories inside it.</para>

      <para>If you click on any XML, JSP or Java source file, you should also
      be able to see the source for those files directly from the
      browser.</para>

      <title>Accessing XDM Tag Documentation</title>

      <para>NEFS <emphasis>Enterprise Console</emphasis> contains complete
      documentation for the XDM tags that are used to create NEFS
      applications. To access this documentation, login to the Enterprise
      Console and click the <guimenuitem>XDM Tags Reference</guimenuitem> tab.
      It displays the documentation for the <sgmltag>Project</sgmltag> tag
      along with a list of its attributes and all the children
      elements.</para>

      <para>Click on a child element to view the corresponding tag
      documentation.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Accessing Command and Value Source Documentation</title>

      <para>The NEF ships with many built-in <sgmltag>Commands</sgmltag> and
      <sgmltag>Value Sources</sgmltag>. You can view a complete list of the
      available commands and value sources through the Enterprise
      Console.</para>

    <title>Using your own App Server to Sample the NEFS on your
    Workstation</title>

    <para>In order to sample the true power of the NEF, you should try the
    samples on your own workstation or server. This section describes the
    prerequisites you need to sample NEFS locally:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Java Developers Kit (JDK) 1.2, 1.3, or 1.4</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>A Servlet Container (application server) supporting the Servlet
        2.2 or higher specification</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <section>
      <title>Make sure you have a Java Developer's Kit (JDK)</title>

      <para>Since NEFS comprises Java libraries, a fundamental requirement to
      develop applications with it is a Java SDK (the full SDK is required,
      the JRE will not be enough). You can obtain Sun’s official Java SDK from
      its Java web site at <ulink
      url="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/download.html">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/download.html</ulink>.
      This is a link to the Java 1.4 SDK but Java 1.2 and 1.3 will also
      work.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Make sure you have an Application Server (Servlet
      Container)</title>

      <para>Since Sparx works with standard J2EE application servers, a
      Servlet container is required if you're going to use Sparx. Both Axiom
      and Commons work in web-based or non-web-based applications but Sparx is
      a web application development library so an application server with a
      Servlet 2.2 or better container is necessary. Sparx-based applications
      have been tested on the following application servers:</para>

      </itemizedlist>

      <note>
        <para>We recommend the <ulink url="http://www.caucho.com">Caucho
        Resin</ulink> application server if you're not familiar with other
        Servlet containers or if you're new to Java/J2EE application servers.
        It's an easy to install, easy to use, and fast Servlet container with
        advanced features that rival other more expensive application servers
        such as WebLogic and WebSphere. Resin is free for development use but
        requires a paid license before putting your application into
        production use. Rest assured though that all Sparx-based applications
        you write, even on Resin, will remain app-server neutral.</para>
      </note>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)</title>

      <para>You can also optionally install a Java integrated development
      environment (IDE) for developing NEFS applications. The Netspective
      Frameworks do not require any particular Java IDE and if you prefer to
      use simple text editors like vi, emacs, or <ulink
      url="http://www.textpad.com">TextPad</ulink> those will work just as
      well. We recommend the free <ulink
      url="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</ulink> IDE or very affordable and
      useful <ulink url="http://www.intellij.org">JetBrain’s IDEA</ulink> for
      those who are not already familiar with other IDEs.</para>

      <title>Evaluating NEFS Using the Sample Applications</title>

      <para>To keep things simple, there's no special "evaluation kit" for
      NEFS -- instead you just download a sample application from <ulink
      url="http://www.netspective.com">http://www.netspective.com</ulink>
      (click "Downloads" at the top of the page then pick "Sample
      Applications" from the Downloads page). Once you download an
      application, just drop it into your favorite Servlet container
      (application server) and you'll be ready for the evaluation. Each of the
      sample applications are provided as app-server-independent <filename
      class="extension">.war</filename> files and each sample app's <filename
      class="extension">.war</filename> file includes all of the NEFS binary
      files, resources, etc. you need to use NEF. Once you have downloaded any
      <filename class="extension">.war</filename> file, you have everything
      you need to start modifying and adding to the app. The typical procedure
      is: <orderedlist>
