  <para>Each dialog may be unit tested inside Console to ensure that user
  requirements are being met and allowing analysts or end users to start
  reviewing a running application quickly and without programmers writing test
  harnesses. As soon as the XML is completed, the test harness is
  automatically created and may be executed by anyone with access to
  Console.</para>
