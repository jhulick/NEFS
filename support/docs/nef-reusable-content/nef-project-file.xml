  <title>The NEF Project File (project.xml)</title>

  <para>All of the NEF (Sparx, Axiom, and Commons) components are declared in
  an <emphasis>input source </emphasis>file known as the <emphasis>Project
  File</emphasis>. The Project File may be either a single file with all
  components or may be broken up into multiple files and pulled into the main
  Project File by using <sgmltag class="starttag">xdm:include</sgmltag>
  tags.</para>

  <para>The default Project File is
  <filename>APP_ROOT/WEB-INF/sparx/project.xml</filename> but may be
  configured to be a different file. Although you may choose an alternate
  location for the Project File, the remainder of this document assumes that
  the Project File is
  <filename>APP_ROOT/WEB-INF/sparx/project.xml</filename></para>
