  <title>Setting up the Starter Application</title>

  <para>For creation of a new NEF based application, you will need to download
  the Starter Application. The starter application is just an empty
  application that contains the minimal set of files required for NEF web
  applications. It doesn't do anything particularly useful but you can use
  this sample as your template for the new project.</para>

    <title>Downloading the Starter Application</title>

    <para>You can download the NEF Starter Application file from <ulink
    url="http://www.netspective.com/corp/downloads/frameworks/samples">http://www.netspective.com/corp/downloads/frameworks/samples</ulink></para>

    <title>Setting up the Starter Application</title>

    <para>Copy the downloaded <filename>nefs-starter-empty.war</filename> file
    to the <filename class="directory">webapps</filename> folder of your
    servlet container (application server) and run (or restart) the
    application server. This will create an Application Directory Structure
    (see <xref linkend="nef-app-dir-structure" />), containing the necessary
    NEF files and sub-folders, under the <filename
    class="directory">webapps</filename> folder of the application
    server.</para>

    <title>Testing the Starter Application in a Browser</title>

    <para>Use a web browser to access the root of the starter application
    using the URL of the form
    http://<replaceable>host</replaceable>:<replaceable>port</replaceable>/nefs-startert-empty.

    Welcome Page.</para>

    <title>Verifying the Console</title>

    <para>Use a browser to access the Console of the Starter Application. This
    will ensure not just the proper configuration of the application but also
    its proper configuration in relax to Sparx. In a web browser, we can go to
    the following URL:
    http://<replaceable>host</replaceable>:<replaceable>port</replaceable>/nefs-startert-empty/console.
    If everything is working, you will see the application Console login
    screen.</para>

    <para>Congratulations! You now have an empty application upon which you
    can build. You can log in to your application's Console. The Console's
    default User Id is <literal>'console</literal>' and the default Password
    is <literal>'console'</literal>(each without quotes). Unless otherwise
    specified, that is the User Id and Password combination you should use if
    the Console prompts you to login.</para>
