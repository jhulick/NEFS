<h1>The Problem</h1>
J2EE open-source tools can leave you vulnerable to more problems by making simple tasks difficult to develop.
And visual development tools buckle at any real application customization and tweaking. In the end you don't
get to deployment like planned. Your J2EE web application is half-baked.

<h1>What the NEFS Does</h1>
The Netspective Enterprise Frameworks Suite (NEFS) lets you build, deploy, and manage clustered mission
critical applications in 1/3 the time with your existing development staff AND existing tools.
<ul class="check-list">
    <li>You get on average 60-80% of your code generated for you</li>
</ul>

<h1>How the NEFS Does It</h1>
By using XML to declare your base-line J2EE and Web Services code, the NEFS open-architecture dramatically eases
development.
<p>
So instead of hand coding everything, you use XML declarative constructs to quickly build to the point when you
can start adding custom business rules (<i>the secret sauce that makes your application unique</i>) into your
application.

    <li>Less coding means faster application development.</li>
</ul>
The NEFS provides a proven application architecture with packaged RAD/XP practices, for a streamlined safe approach
to application assembly, testing, deployment, and management as a single, integrated solution. NEFS dramatically
reduces the time and resources you need to build, deploy, manage and change applications, while shielding you from
the complexities of J2EE.

<h1>Why you need the NEFS</h1>
<h2>Your app is too important to experiment with right now.</h2>
NEFS gels with your current tools by adding on an extensive library of pre-built and well-tested e-business
functionality and database components and services.

<h2>You don't have time to learn the intricacies of J2EE.</h2>
With NEFS you can opt to use XML to code in a simpler declarative style instead of a programmatic style.
As you get comfortable with J2EE you can also automatically generate your own Java.

<h2>You want a toolset that takes your app development from A to Z.</h2>
Automate the generation of navigation, forms, validations, static/dynamic SQL, unit testing, statistics, security,
documentation and more.

<h2>You're short on help but still need more expert development.</h2>
NEFS generates for you and automatically maintaines process artifacts like unit tests and documentation that
would've taken weeks of back and forth development time.

<h2>You want to customize without giving up consistency.</h2>
NEFS allows you to tweak your application and re-use those components on other projects by providing built-in
metrics, an administration console, and performance statistics.
