<h1>The Sparx Application Platform</h1>
Because Sparx comes out-of-the-box with skinable navigation systems, auto validated forms and ports to any thin-device,
it takes under 30 minutes to fully prototype your J2EE applications and prep them for Axiom's data bindings and
Commons' security authenticators. By starting your development process with Sparx, the bulk of your application's
presentation code is geneerated for you giving you more time to focus on any customization you may have.

<ul class="check-list">
    <li>Just declare your input fields, page navigation and validation criteria in simple XML files and let Sparx
        generate all HTML, error trapping, and Java code for you.</li>
    <li>Create entire application mockups, including navigation and data entry, without expert programmers.</li>
    <li>Once your prototypes are complete, drop in the business rules and application logic using standard Java and
        you'll be able to complete entire application functions in minutes instead of hours and days.</li>
</ul>
