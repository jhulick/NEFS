<h1>Struts and Sparx both create industrial-strength applications</h1>
Struts is a great Framework. Just like Sparx, Struts was designed to support complex industrial-strength web
applications. However, Struts simply requires too many JSP and HTML pages and too many lines of Java code just to perform
simple data entry and navigation tasks. Many programmers integrate other templating systems like Tiles to help simplify
Struts development but end up struggling with multiple open source code packages that still require too much HTML and
Java to do anything useful.

<h1>What does Sparx do that Struts doesn't?</h1>
Because Struts is designed only for the navigation, controller, and dispatcher portions of your applications, it has the
following shortcomings:
<ul class="check-list-body">
    <li>Struts doesn't help you with your user interface's design (navigation styles, links, look and feel, etc.). You'll
        need a good HTML designer or be content with UI's that will not impress your users.
    <li>Struts doesn't support built-in login, multiple attempts lockout, logout, and timeout. You'll have to write authentication code yourself.
    <li>Struts doesn't support automated sitemap generation.
    <li>Struts doesn't support complex server-side field and form validations without extra Java code or additional libraries.
    <li>Struts doesn't support sophisticated client-side validation, conditionals, keypress filters, and data formatting. You'll have to write your own JavaScript.
    <li>Struts doesn't support any database operations. You'll need to find and integrate a persistence framework.
    <li>Struts doesn't support role-based personalized applications (security) without writing your own authorization code.
    <li>Struts has relatively new and limited support for subsites and sub-applications.
    <li>Struts doesn't support creating libraries of inheritable and reusable pages, forms, fields, validations, business rules/values, and commands. You have limited reuse options.
</ul>

<ul class="check-list">
    <li>Sparx eliminates up to 90% of HTML, Java, and JavaScript code required by Struts.
</ul>
