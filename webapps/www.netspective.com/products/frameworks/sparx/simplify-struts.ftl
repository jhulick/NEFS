<h1>Struts and Sparx both create industrial-strength applications</h1>
Struts is a great Framework. Just like Sparx, Struts was designed to support complex industrial-strength web
applications. However, Struts simply requires too many JSP and HTML pages and too many lines of Java code just to perform
simple data entry and navigation tasks. Many programmers end up add other templating systems like Tiles to help simplify
Struts development but end up struggling with multiple open source code packages that still require too much HTML and
Java to do anything useful.

<h1>What does Sparx do that Struts doesn't?</h1>
Because Struts is designed only for the navigation, controller, and dispatcher portions of your applications, it has the
following shortcomings:
<ul class="check-list-body">
    <li>It doesn't help you with your user interface's design (navigation styles, links, look and feel, etc.). You'll
        need a good HTML designer or be content with UI's that will not impress your users.
    <li>It doesn't support built-in login, logout, and timeout. You'll have to write security code yourself.
    <li>It doesn't support automated sitemap generation (define your pages in XML and get automatic sitemap).
    <li>It doesn't support complex server-side field and form validations without extra Java code.
    <li>It doesn't support client-side validation. You'll have to do write your own JavaScript.
    <li>It doesn't support page, form, and field inheritance. You will have limited reuse capabilities.
    <li>It doesn't support any database operations. You'll need to find and integrate a persistence framework.
    <li>It doesn't support role-based personalized applications (security) without writing your own code.
    <li>It has relatively new and limited support for subsites and sub-applications.
    <li>It doesn't support creating libraries of reusable forms, fields, validations, business rules/values, and commands.
</ul>

<ul class="check-list">
    <li>Sparx eliminates up to 90% of HTML, Java, and JavaScript code that you would manually if you use Struts.
</ul>
