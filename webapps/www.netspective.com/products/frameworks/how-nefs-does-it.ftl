By using XML to declare common J2EE and Web Services code and plain Java for customizations and extensibility, the NEFS open-architecture dramatically simplifies
development.
<p>
So instead of hand coding everything, you use XML declarative constructs to quickly build to the point when you
can start adding custom business rules (<i>the secret sauce that makes your application unique</i>) into your
application using plain Java.
<ul class="check-list">
    <li>More declarations and less coding means faster application development.</li>
    <li>Experts can still customize and tweak our Frameworks using standard Java extension mechansims such as dynamic
        class loading, inheritance, and delegation.</li>
</ul>
The NEFS provides a proven application architecture, with packaged RAD/XP practices, for a painless approach
to application assembly, testing, deployment, and management. All as a single, integrated solution that doesn't make
you buy all-new app servers, database servers, or learn a new IDE.
<ul class="check-list">
    <li>NEFS dramatically
        reduces the time and resources you need to build, deploy, manage and change applications, while shielding you from
        the complexities of J2EE.</li>
    <li>NEFS-based applications are deployed as standard <code>.war</code> files with no special vendor-specific extensions.</li>
</ul>
