Medigy is an enterprise framework built specifically to support healthcare and medical informatics applications.
Medigy provides healthcare IT groups, independent software vendors, consulting groups, and systems integrators with a
set of tools that simplify the development of healthcare applications to help improve programmer productivity, increase
quality, and reduce costs.
<p>
Medigy uses XML, Java, J2EE, web servers, and standard application servers to help construct platform- and
database-neutral medical applications for all healthcare customers. It includes pre-built objects, data models,
web services, and process models that are used in most healthcare applications.
