Using Medigy, healthcare IT groups can finally stop building applications from scratch each time and leverage existing
talent, databases, and components to reduce time to market, improve quality, and cut costs.

<h1>Why Medigy?</h1>
Developing and delivering healthcare applications is a time-consuming, complex, and costly endeavor.
IT groups in healthcare organizations are struggling with competing demands from clinical users, business users, and
financial users. Healthcare applications demand high quality, easy accessibility, good privacy, excellent security,
and simplified user interfaces all at a low price point. Most organizations opt for commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS)
solutions but find out that customization and new applications remain a necessity to keep up with competitive and
cost-cutting measures.

Medigy leverages Netspective's other Enterprise Frameworks (Commons, Axiom, Sparx). It was designed as a healthcare and
medical informatics <i>platform</i> or <i>framework</i> that would allow web
services, information transparency, legacy integration, data consolidation, customer relationship management,
enterprise reporting, and knowledge management applications to be <i>built on top of an existing infrastructure</i>.
