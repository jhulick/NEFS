<h1>You may need NEFS if:</h1>
<h2>Your app is too important to experiment with right now.</h2>
NEFS gels with your current tools by adding an extensive library of pre-built and well-tested e-business
and database components and services. Don't throw away your existing tools or IDEs and don't worry about hiring new programmers.
Use what you have.

<h2>You don't have time to learn the intricacies of J2EE.</h2>
With NEFS you can opt to use XML to code in a simpler declarative style instead of a programmatic style.
As you get comfortable with J2EE you can also automatically generate your own Java.

<h2>You want a toolset that takes your app development from A to Z.</h2>
You don't have to cobble together dozens of different open-source or commericial libraries. Automate the generation of
navigation, forms, validations, static/dynamic SQL, unit testing, statistics, security, documentation and more <i>using
one package from one company that is only a phone call or e-mail away</i>.
<ul class="check-list">
    <li>NEFS icludes pre-tested and fully integrated versions of your favorite open source tools like Ant, Log4J, many Jakarta
Commons libraries, JUnit, HttpUnit, and many others.</li>
</ul>

<h2>You're short on help but still need more expert development.</h2>
NEFS generates for you and automatically maintaines process artifacts like unit tests and documentation that
would've taken weeks of back and forth development time.

<h2>You want to customize without giving up consistency.</h2>
NEFS allows you to tweak your application and re-use those components on other projects by providing built-in
metrics, an administration console, and performance statistics.

<h2>You want service and support that is second-to-none.</h2>

We stand behind all of our producs with service and support designed for mission- and safety-critical work. We provide
