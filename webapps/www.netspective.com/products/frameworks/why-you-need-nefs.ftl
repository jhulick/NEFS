<h1>You may need NEFS if:</h1>
<h2>Your app is too important to experiment with right now.</h2>
NEFS gels with your current tools by adding an extensive library of pre-built and well-tested e-business
and database components and services. Don't throw away your existing tools or IDEs and don't worry about hiring
new programmers. Use what you have.


<h2>You want the power of J2EE but the simplicity of Visual Basic.</h2>
NEFS user interfaces are easy to create, it's data components are painless to use, and its security model
is simple to integrate. However, the true power of NEFS comes through its extensibility since Java and J2EE APIs
are never out of reach. You'll never find yourself stuck in our frameworks because they allow you to customize and tweak
your application using standard Java extension mechansims such as dynamic class loading, getting files using resource
locators, extending classes using inheritance, and off-loading work to delegation classes.
<ul class="check-list">
    <li>With NEFS you can opt to use XML to code in a simpler declarative style instead of a programmatic style.
        As you get comfortable with J2EE you can extend or replace our Java classes with your own custom classes.</li>
</ul>


<h2>You want a toolset that takes your app development from A to Z.</h2>
You don't have to cobble together a solution comprised of dozens of different open-source or commericial libraries.
Automate the generation of navigation, forms, validations, static/dynamic SQL, unit testing, statistics, security,
documentation and more using a <i>single</i> suite from <i>one</i> company.
<ul class="check-list">
    <li>NEFS icludes pre-tested and fully integrated versions of your favorite open source tools like Ant, Log4J, many Jakarta
        Commons libraries, JUnit, HttpUnit, and many others. Chances are you're probably familiar with many of the
        NEFS components already.</li>
</ul>


<h2>You're short on help but still need process artifacts.</h2>
NEFS generates for you and automatically maintains XP/Agile, RUP, CMMI, and Waterfall process methodology
artifacts like application metrics, unit tests, and traceability documentation that would've taken weeks of back and
forth development time.


<h2>You want service and support that is second-to-none.</h2>
Netspective has been around since 1997 and our programmers have been creating frameworks for a living for over 15 years.
We stand behind all of our producs with service and support designed for mission- and safety-critical work. We provide
support via e-mail, telephone, video conference, instant messenger, and even in-person when necessary.
