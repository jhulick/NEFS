<h1>Try it online</h1>
The quickest way to evaluate the NEF is to view all the documentation online and follow along with the online
versions of the sample applications. Since all you need is a web browser, you can start learning about NEF immediately.
<p>
<ul>
    <li>View the "<a href="${vc.rootUrl}/sampler/documentation/getting-started" target="sampler">Getting Started</a>" document
    <li>Visit <a href="${vc.rootUrl}/sampler" target="sampler">the Sampler site</a>
</ul>

<h1>Try it on your own workstation</h1>

The recommended method of evaluating NEF is to download sample applications and install them in your own application
server. You'll need to download and install a Java Developer's Kit (JDK), an application server, and one or more NEF
sample applications on your own server.
<p>
<ul>
    <li>View the "<a href="${vc.rootUrl}/sampler/documentation/getting-started" target="sampler">Getting Started</a>" document
    <li>Download the <a href="${vc.rootUrl}/sampler/sample-apps" target="sampler">sample applications</a>
</ul>

<b>Note</b>:
Each of the downloadable sample applications are provided as app-server-independent <code>.war</code> files. Each sample
app's <code>.war</code> file includes all of the NEF binary files, resources, and everything you need to use NEF.
Once you have downloaded any <code>.war</code> file from the Sampler site, you have everything you need to start
modifying and adding to the app.
