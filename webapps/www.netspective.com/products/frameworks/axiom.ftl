<h1>The Axiom Data Service</h1>
Without forcing you to drop down to Java, Axiom is able to completely bind and execute your static and dynamic SQL by
using just a few simple lines of XML. Use any relational database server to generate add/edit/delete SQL that tie into the
Sparx Presentation Framework. Even legacy data can be brought in by using Axiom's built-in SQL generator saving time and
making the entire process simple.

    <li>Axiom can often shave weeks, if not months, of SQL data development tasks and
        your code is less prone to error caused by repetitive tasks.
    </li>
    <li>Automatic performance statistics gathering and externalization of SQL from your application code leaves you
        with less brittle code.</li>
</ul>
