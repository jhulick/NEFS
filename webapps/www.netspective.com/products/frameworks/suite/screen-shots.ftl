<h1>Effortless Navigation and Skinable User Interfaces</h1>
NEFS ships with several professionally-designed themes that you use right out of the box and get great looking
apps without the help of any designers. As you can see from the examples below,
NEFS UIs can appear any way that will appeal to your users. They can look like traditional websites, like
desktop applications, or anything in between. Best of all, you can usually change looks and feel centrally with one
line of code.

<table align=center cellpadding=7>
    <tr>
        <td><@screenShot name="sampler-home"/></td>
        <td><@screenShot name="hello-forms-home"/></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><@screenShot name="survey-home"/></td>
        <td><@screenShot name="survey-data-entry"/></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><@screenShot name="console-sample"/></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<ul class="check-list">
    <li>User interfaces and themes may be personalized for a given user, a role, or a firm. That way, the same site and
        functionality may appear different to various users based on your own business and design rules.
    <li>Slick user interfaces that used to take days and weeks using expensive designers can now be completed
in less time and the UI remains soft: as requirements change, so can the UI - without affecting code.
    <li>This website you're viewing is also written using the NEFS user interface generator so you can see that the UI
        may be branded quite easily.
</ul>

<h1>Advanced Data Entry Forms</h1>
Most Enterprise applications require sophisticated data entry features. Our Frameworks give you complex data entry
forms without you writing a single line of HTML. We support dozens of field types including, but not limited to:
text fields, memo and HTML fields, numeric and credit card fields, date and boolean fields, grids, composites,
popups, and many different select style fields.
<p>
<@screenShot name="dialogs"/>

<ul class="check-list">
    <li>All the fields' looks and feel are managed centrally by themes and skins. When you change a skin or theme, all
        occurrences automatically change.
    <li>Field contents may be conditional on the server- or client-side (using DHTML).
    <li>All data binding, field populatin, data validation, and error reporting is completely automatic.
</ul>
