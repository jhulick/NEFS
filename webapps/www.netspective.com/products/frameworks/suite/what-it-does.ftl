<h1>The Problem</h1>
Open-source tools often make simple tasks difficult to complete.
And commercial visual HTML editors buckle when industrial-strength applications are required. You end up with UIs
that may not please your customers, insufficiently secured apps, data management that is too slow, or worse with projects that may fail
entirely.

<h1>What the NEFS Does</h1>
The Netspective Enterprise Frameworks Suite (NEFS) lets you build, deploy, and manage highly available and secure mission
critical applications. It does this using your existing development staff AND existing app servers,
databases, and IDEs.
<ul class="check-list">
    <li>Build apps 3 times faster than using app servers and J2EE alone.</li>
    <li>Generate up to 80% of tedious user-interface, data management, and security code automatically.</li>
    <li>Deliver apps that look as good as they work, without requiring dedicated designers.</li>
    <li>Customize and extend the frameworks using Java inheritance and delegation.</li>
</ul>
