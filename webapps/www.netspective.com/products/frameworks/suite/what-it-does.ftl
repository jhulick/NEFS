<h1>The Problem</h1>
Open-source tools often make simple tasks difficult to complete.
And commercial visual HTML editors buckle when industrial-strength applications are required. You end up with UIs
that may not please your customers, insufficiently secured apps, data management that is too slow, or worse with projects that may fail
entirely.

<h1>The Challenges that NEFS Addresses</h1>
The Netspective Enterprise Frameworks Suite (NEFS) addresses numerous challenges faced by junior engineers, senior
architects, and development managers on a daily basis. If you can not fully answer one or more of the questions posed below,
you need the NEFS.
<ul>
    <li>Does it take you days or weeks to create application mockups and prototypes when your customers expect them in hours?</li>
    <li>Can you sit with your customers and create full-fledged navigation, page flow, and forms mockups in minutes while the customers watch?</li>
    <li>Are your customers impressed and delighted with the user interfaces you create?</li>
    <li>When you start a new application, do you know how you will structure the GUI? How will users interact with the
        GUI that you design? How long will it take to create the web designs?</li>
    <li>How should you separate server-side/transport data formats from your GUI?</li>
    <li>How should you provide sound mechanisms for event management, application flows, and widget control?</li>
    <li>How will you divide your visual entities (panels, components, etc.) into panes with specific, consistent
        responsibilities and functions?</li>
    <li>How will you separate your GUI layout code from your GUI feature code (validation, events, etc.) from your application
        flow, navigation, server interaction, and business logic code?</li>
    <li>How will the presentation components be separted from service components and how will the interaction between
        the services and GUI be defined and orchestrated?</li>
    <li>Is your code easy to maintain because it follows the principles of dependency inversion?</li>
    <li>How do you ensure your application's design is not rigid, brittle, and monolithic?</li>
    <li>Will your presentation layer provide a strong, orderly way to implement application logic and flow?</li>
    <li>Are your developers spending so much time on infrastructure coding that they don't have enough time to spend on business logic?</li>
    <li>Do your customers find bugs that your developers should have found in unit tests?</li>
    <li>Is your SQL embedded inside your Java code instead of being externalized for easier maintenance?</li>
    <li>How much time are you spending writing DAOs, VOs, and wrapper objects for your persistence layer?</li>
    <li>Are you convinced that your developers have thoroughly integrated security, privacy, and encryption in every page, field, and business rule of your application?</li>
    <li>Are your programmers as productive as you think they should be?</li>
    <li>Are developers on your team using standard design patterns (Abstract Factories, Composite, Chain of Responsibility, Facade, etc.) to provide a stable design?</li>
</ul>

<h1>What the NEFS Does</h1>
The Netspective Enterprise Frameworks Suite (NEFS) lets you build, deploy, and manage highly available and secure mission
critical applications. It does this using your existing development staff AND existing app servers,
databases, and IDEs.
<ul class="check-list">
    <li>Build apps 3 times faster than using app servers and J2EE alone.</li>
    <li>Generate up to 80% of tedious user-interface, data management, and security code automatically.</li>
    <li>Deliver apps that look as good as they work, without requiring dedicated designers.</li>
    <li>Customize and extend the frameworks using Java inheritance and delegation.</li>
</ul>
