Declare input fields, page navigation and validation criteria in simple XML files. Define database schema in XML and
generate SQL DDL and type-safe table-based DAOs. Automatically manage roles and permissions at granular levels and without
programmer intervention. Customize our framework using standard Java extension mechanisms.

<h1>Instantiate Components using XML, Customize using Java</h1>
Instead of hand-coding object construction in Java, you use XML declarations to instantiate and configure our high-level
Java classes in external resource files.
<ul class="check-list">
    <li>More declarations and less coding means faster application development and lower learning-curve.</li>
    <li>High-level XML tags shield you from the complexities of J2EE.</li>
</ul>

When you are ready to customize the actions or attach events, you just use Java.
<ul class="check-list">
    <li>You don't have to learn a new programming language or scripting system.</li>
    <li>You can customize and tweak our Frameworks using standard Java extension mechansims such as dynamic class loading, inheritance, and delegation.
</ul>

It fits in your current environment.

    <li>NEFS is delivered as a single, integrated solution that doesn't make you buy all-new app servers, database servers, or learn a new IDE.</li>
    <li>NEFS-based applications are deployed as standard <code>.war</code> files with no special vendor-specific extensions.</li>
</ul>
