<h1>Clean Separation of Business Logic from other Layers</h1>
The NEFS is architectured to help you cleanly and consistently separate presentation from business logic and business
logic from the data management layer. It includes a foundation for translating the business logic into business
processes that are reusable across multiple projects. The business logic and processes may be invoked through many
protocols including RMI, plain-old Java objects (POJO), Web Services, Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs) and messaging.

<h1>Encapsulating Technical Complexity</h1>
The NEFS is architected to let you focus on the business components of your systems by encapsulating the technical
complexities of the J2EE APIs and Frameworks into higher-level APIs and classes. You concentrate on your app and its
functionality and we take care of the architecture and infrastructure issues.

<h1>Complete Extensiblity through SPI-based Plug-ins</h1>
We implement a Service Provider Interface (SPI) based plug-in design that allows you to override or replace any of our
classes through XML or Java. This includes replacing our factories with your factories and our design pattern implementations
with your own implementations.

<h1>Easy Integration</h1>
NEFS is architected using Java, J2EE and XML technologies. NEFS does not have a proprietary
development language and doesn't require a specific Integrated Development Environment (IDE). NEFS fits with model
driven and iterative development processes, such as eXtreme Programming (XP) or Rational unified Process (RUP).
