There are many freely-available open source frameworks that are quite useful for certain types of applications. There are a
number of good tools in this category like Struts, Sofia, Enhydra, Expresso, and others; however, they all share the
following issues:

<ul>
    <li>You don't have "one throat to choke" when there's a problem -- because free tools don't come with support, you won't be able to make a phone call or send an e-mail to a single source (like us) for support.
    <li>None of these free products match NEF from a feature or functionality perspective (to compare, see our <a href="${servletPath}/products/frameworks/suite/features">Features</a>).
    <li>Most of the open source tools cater to very talented Java engineers since they require a serious understanding of low-level computer science concepts, J2EE APIs, and Java programming.
    <li>Most open source tools are written <i>by</i> experienced programmers <i>for</i> experienced programmers and as such depend on mutual understanding instead of heavy documentation.
    <li>While they save money in the beginning (since they are free) they end up costing much more because they often require engineer with a great deal of experience, usually require a higher number of engineers because the tools lack features you'll have to implement, and don't have the quality management and artifact generation tools built-in.
</ul>
NEF can complement or replace most frameworks like Struts, Sofia, or Expresso. And, you get complete source code just
like all the open source solutions.
