Why use the Netspective Frameworks Suite instead of creating your own, using commercial embedded,
commercial standalone, or other open-source frameworks? Because NEF is a comprehensive and easy to use J2EE
architectural framework solution (whereas other products are only partial solutions).
<p>

<h1>Modern app development is about more than just coding</h1>
Even if all of your engineers are very experienced and your architecture is very sound, part of every J2EE application
development process is spent in prototyping, technical writing, testing and maintenance.
So even if your code is completed
on time, these other tasks take up to another 30 to 40% of the total project resources.

NEF can take an experienced
J2EE programmer and improve their productivity and in many cases eliminate the need for specialized resources for
architecture and design, prototyping, documentation, logging, deployment and maintenance.

</ul>
