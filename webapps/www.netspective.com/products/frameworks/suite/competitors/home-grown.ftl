Due to the lack of robust commercial offerings, today many development teams choose to build their own frameworks and
platforms. Your in-house and home-grown solutions tend to have a great deal of momentum behind them because they may
be favored internally by the experienced and senior engineers that construct them. However, home-grown solutions exhibit
the following shortcomings:
<ul>
    <li>They often have limited features (to compare, see our <a href="${servletPath}/products/frameworks/features">Features</a>).
    <li>They are usually poorly documented.
    <li>They are notoriously difficult to extend because they are typically designed for special-purpose jobs.
    <li>They are expensive to create and maintain and require engineering attention which is taken away from business requirements.
    <li>Programmers often end up wasting time on infrastructure issues instead of issues that directly affect end-users.
</ul>
With its unique architecture, NEF can supplement in-house frameworks or replace them completely. We are able to work
alongside home-grown solutions and be extensible enough to allow enterprises to make a slow switch over to NEF.
