Due to the lack of robust commercial offerings, today most enterprises choose to build their own frameworks and
platforms. Your in-house and home-grown solutions tend to have a great deal of momentum behind them because they may
be favored internally by the experienced and senior engineers that construct them. However, home-grown solutions exhibit
the following shortcomings:
<ul>
    <li>They often have limited features (to compare, see our <a href="${servletPath}/products/frameworks/features">Features</a>).
    <li>They are usually poorly documented.
    <li>They are notoriously difficult to extend because they are usually designed for special-purpose jobs.
    <li>They are usually expensive to create and maintain and require engineering attention which is taken away from business requirements. Programmers often end up spending time on infrastructure issues instead of issues that directly affect end-users.
</ul>
With its unique architecture, NEF can supplement in-house frameworks or replace them completely. We are able to work
alongside home-grown solutions and be extensible enough to allow enterprises to make a slow switch over to NEF.
