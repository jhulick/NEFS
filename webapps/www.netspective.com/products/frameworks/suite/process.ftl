Programming paradigms like Extreme Programming (XP) and Rational™ (RUP), have exploded into the developer community due to the high demand for shorter development cycles. By dissecting development projects into staged tasks, Agile Methodologies like XP promise rapid application development.
<p>
Although the benefits for such paradigms are tremendous, the risks for potential project failure increase exponentially. There is simply no room for mistakes at this pace.
<p>
The solution is simple: Rely on a proven architecture that complements multiple paradigms: The Netspective Enterprise Frameworks.
<p>
Our Java Frameworks deliver benefits to your programming process by:
<ul class="check-list-in-body">
    <li>Keeping software soft
    <li>Handling changing requirements with relative ease
    <li>Allowing average developers to produce great software
    <li>Continually producing useful client-driven enhancements
</ul>
The risk of trial-and-error development is eliminated. Your enterprise keeps pace with even the most demanding programming paradigms.
