Programming paradigms like XP and RUP have exploded into the developer community due to the high demand for a more
controlled engineering process. Although the benefits for such paradigms are tremendous, the risks for potential project
failure increase because of process learning curve and artifacts preparation tasks.
<p>
The solution is simple: rely on our tools that complement multiple paradigms. Our Java Frameworks deliver benefits to
your programming process by:
<ul class="check-list-in-body">
    <li>Delivering powerful prototyping features which allow users to see what they're getting before coding begins.
    <li>Keeping software soft (UI, database, and other components are kept in resource files instead of code).
    <li>Handling changing requirements with relative ease (less Java code to deal with).
    <li>Providing tools that help generate process artifacts like functional specs, metrics, and design documents.
</ul>
