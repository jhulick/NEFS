Bundled with the NEFS is the Netspective Enterprise Console (NEC). The browser-based interface displays all of your
application's dynamic components and objects enabling your development team to collectively manage the application
development process.
<p>
The Enterprise Console is an invaluable debugging aid, diagnostic tool, documentation management system, and process
artifact collection utility in one thin client application. And, because it's a standard NEFS application it's a great
demonstration and sample application.

<h1>Automatic Documentation</h1>
Your development team concentrates on implementation of business functionality while the Enterprise Console automatically
collects all relevant project metrics, documentation, and details. Managers can use ACE in real-time to track programmer work and productivity.
