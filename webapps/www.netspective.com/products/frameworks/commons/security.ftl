<h1>The Commons Core Library Security Service</h1>
Most companies think security is about protecting servers and networks using firewalls and encryption using SSL. While
that's a must, it's only a start. The majority of hacking that occurs takes place at the application level which means
data protection and security code must be be built into the application itself.

<h1>Generate all the important Security Components</h1>
NEFS' Commons Core Library Security Service automatically generates all the important application security
features such as role-based access control, fine-grained hierarchical permissions, login forms, and
automatic sign-out.

<h1>Manage your Application Security in One Place</h1>
NEFS's Security Service is centrally managed at the MVC layer and can be added at any time during the development
process. Individual developers can count on "base-level" security and only be worried about adding on
top of it.
<ul class="check-list">
    <li>Sub-sites and multiple modules may share a common security scheme or create their own.
    <li>Because all NEFS security is declarative, you can generate reports of application components that are not secured properly.
</ul>

<h1>Overview of Commons Security Service Tags</h1>
Commons defines and processes numerous, very high-level, tags that you use to declare security
components. <p>
