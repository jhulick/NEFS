<h1>The Problem</h1>
Open-source tools often make simple tasks difficult to complete.
And commercial visual development tools buckle at any real application customization and tweaking. You end up with user interfaces
that may not please your customers, with data management that is too slow, or worse with projects that may fail
entirely.

<h1>What the NEFS Does</h1>
The Netspective Enterprise Frameworks Suite (NEFS) lets you build, deploy, and manage highly available and secure mission
critical applications in a third of the time with your existing development staff AND existing app servers, databases, and IDEs.
<ul class="check-list">
    <li>You get up to 80% of tedious user-interface, data management, and security code written for you.</li>
    <li>Your application will look as good as it works, without requiring dedicated designers. But, if you have designers,
        they can still have complete control without stepping on any programmers' toes.</li>
    <li>The only Java code you write are customizations or tweaks for application-specific requirements.</li>
</ul>
