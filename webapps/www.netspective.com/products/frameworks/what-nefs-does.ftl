<h1>The Problem</h1>
Open-source tools often make simple tasks difficult to complete.
And commercial visual development tools buckle at any real application customization and tweaking. You end up with user interfaces
that may not please your customers, with data management that is too slow, or worse with projects that may fail
entirely.

<h1>What the NEFS Does</h1>
The Netspective Enterprise Frameworks Suite (NEFS) lets you build, deploy, and manage highly available and secure mission
critical applications in 1/3 the time with your existing development staff AND existing app servers, databases, and IDEs.
<ul class="check-list">
    <li>You get up to 80% of tedious user-interface, data management, and security code written for you.</li>
    <li>Your application will look as good as it works, without requiring dedicated designers. But, if you have designers,
        they can still have complete control without stepping on any programmers' toes.</li>
    <li>The only Java code you write are customizations or tweaks for application-specific requirements.</li>
</ul>

<h1>How the NEFS Does It</h1>
By using XML to declare common J2EE and Web Services code and plain Java for customizations and extensibility, the NEFS open-architecture dramatically simplifies
development.
<p>
So instead of hand coding everything, you use XML declarative constructs to quickly build to the point when you
can start adding custom business rules (<i>the secret sauce that makes your application unique</i>) into your
application using plain Java.
<ul class="check-list">
    <li>More declarations, less coding means faster application development.</li>
</ul>
The NEFS provides a proven application architecture, with packaged RAD/XP practices, for a painless approach
to application assembly, testing, deployment, and management. All as a single, integrated solution that doesn't make
you buy all-new app servers, database servers, or learn a new IDE.
<ul class="check-list">
    <li>NEFS dramatically
        reduces the time and resources you need to build, deploy, manage and change applications, while shielding you from
        the complexities of J2EE.</li>
</ul>
