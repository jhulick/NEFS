<h1>Introduction</h1>
Successful e-businesses are dependent on repeatable and automated software processes and delivery. Simply having development policies doesn't ensure proper implementation during the development and build process.
<p>
Our customers realize that a common development platform is needed to optimize development processes by making them repeatable. But most development tools today focus only on coding process and leave out the design, testing, deployment and maintenance of data-critical applications and Web Services.
<p>
Netspective develops XML and Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE)™ platforms that enable enterprises to build sophisticated e-business applications faster than ever before.
<p>
Our products simplify the development process by allowing existing senior technical resources to focus on corporate IT initiatives and architecture while providing junior resources the tools to deliver mission-critical functionality, code, and documentation.

<h1>Taking J2EE Application Servers Further</h1>
J2EE application servers like BEA WebLogic, Oracle AS or IBM WebSphere and Servlet containers like Caucho Resin and Jakarta Tomcat provide excellent infrastructure services; however, by themselves, they are complex and lack ready-to-use application functionality, architecture, and data management components.
<p>
Netspective has built upon these J2EE application servers, yet has reduced complexity and significantly improved their ability to meet the business objectives for which they were deployed.

<h1>Customer Success</h1>
For in-house IT departments, like TRW and The American Red Cross, an immediate return on IT investment is realized by removing development hurdles associated with J2EE. Our highly adaptable and reusable open-ended architecture has significantly reduced ownership costs for global system integrators like COMSYS.
