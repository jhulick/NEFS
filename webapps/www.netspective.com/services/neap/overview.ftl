<h1>What is an Enterprise Information Architecture?</h1>
An enterprise architecture powers and supports your organization's most critical business processes:
<ul class="check-list-in-body">
    <li>It manages corporate knowledge and expertise
    <li>It is your company's software and hardware infrastructure
    <li>It maintains all your company's data stores
    <li>It enables installation of horizontal and custom applications
</ul>
<h1>How can you tell if Enterprise Architecture is <i>not</i> well-crafted?</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Do you notice silos of information that prevent information sharing and business collaboration?
    <li>Do you have many ad hoc systems?
    <li>Do you see unnecessary redundancy in your infrastructure?
    <li>Are there many applications that duplicate functionality?
    <li>Do your systems seem inflexible?
</ul>
If you answered "yes" to any of the questions above then your enterprise architecture may be <i>non-performant</i>
because of age or just poor design.

<h1>Netspective's Enterprise Architecture Planning Service</h1>
Our Enterprise Architecture Planning (EAP) Turn-key Service can help you design and craft
extensible architecture blueprints in a matter of days or weeks. Our EAP is a unique
service that provides a knowledge bridge between your business and technology
groups to help you create a results-oriented architecture.

<p>First we assess your business drivers and corporate strategy. Using that
understanding, we collaboratively develop an <i>adoptable</i> enterprise architecture plan
that will have the best ability to be implemented. We help you create more
than documents and guidelines: we help you choose the right technologies, give you the
support you need to install and implement those technologies, and can even help you
integrate your legacy business systems and processes into your new architecture.
Using our NEAP service we can work together to rapidly optimizing your hardware and software
infrastructure, enterprise applications, and data.
