    <tr>
        <td>Free Point Revisions</td>
        <td>
            Point revisions are usually defect-related upgrades that occur in the third number in our Release
            identifiers. For example, an ugrade from 7.0.1 to 7.0.2 (the third digit) would constitute a point release
            but from 7.1 to 7.2 would not (since those are larger enhancement releases).
