<h1>NEFS is much less expensive than hiring software engineers</h1>
When you consider that one NEFS license costs about the same as 8 hours of engineering work, you will realize
that its cost is easy to justify. The price is usually insignificant compared to the cost of hiring a single engineer
to write even a single complex form.
