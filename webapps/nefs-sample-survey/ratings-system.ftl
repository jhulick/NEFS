This person believes that the <strong>impact</strong> of a natural hazard would be a nine (high) but that the <strong>likelihood</strong> of a natural disaster is a one (low). This respondent combined these two ratings to reach a rating of five for <strong>significance</strong>. They have rated the risk "eight" (high) in all three categories for <strong>management effectiveness</strong>. Management has controlled the risk well with insurance, emergency procedures, and sound structures. This person believes that while a natural disaster poses a medium risk, that Battelle management has taken many precautions.</p></div>
