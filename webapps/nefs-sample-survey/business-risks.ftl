<div align="left" style="padding:10"><p>Business risks are the uncertainties, both hazards and opportunities, that the organization must understand and effectively manage to execute its strategies, achieve its business objectives, and create value. We provide a <a href="../../risk-inv.jsp">Business Risk Inventory</a> as a tool to define an organization's business risk universe and identify key business risks that impact Battelle as a whole or one or more business processes. This inventory separates business risk into external and internal (e.g., strategic, operational, and financial) categories:</p><p><strong>External Risks:</strong> Changing market conditions and the competitive environment that affect the ability of Battelle to achieve its business objectives and strategies.</p><p><strong>Internal Risks:</strong> Changes to the company infrastructure, processes, policies, personnel, and facilities that affect the ability of Battelle to achieve its business objectives and strategies.</p>	<ul>        <li><strong>Strategic Risks:</strong> Adaptability and suitability of Battelle’s core business strategies to the external market conditions and environment that affect its ability to accomplish its objectives.</li>	</ul>	<ul>		<li><strong>Operational Risks:</strong> Changes in Battelle’s processes that affect the business model, the ability to satisfy customers' and stakeholders' needs, and Battelle's quality, cost, and time performance objectives.</li>     			<ul>				<li><strong>Process Risk:</strong> Changes in Battelle's processes that affect the business model, the ability to satisfy customers' and stakeholders' needs, and Battelle's quality, cost, and time performance objectives.</li>				<li><strong>Human Capital Risk:</strong> Training, skills, experience, guidance, understanding of business objectives, limits to employee authority, and degree of definition in employee roles that can affect Battelle employee's ability to pursue the company’s business objectives.</li>				<li><strong>Business Reporting Risk:</strong> Completeness, accuracy, and timeliness of information to relevant parties or the types of decisions made on the basis of that information.</li>				<li><strong>Integrity Risk:</strong> Ethics and employee behavior that can change Battelle's reputation and image.</li>				<li><strong>Technology Risk:</strong> Hardware, software, systems, or personnel that affect Battelle’s ability to gather, synthesize, or transmit information needed for operations and processes.</li>       			</ul>	</ul>	<ul>	<li><strong>Financial Risks:</strong> Effectiveness of management of cash flows that cause changes in revenue, Battelle’s economic value, and the overall stability of Battelle.</li>	</ul><p>These categories of business risk provide a broad foundation from which more specific risks can be identified and detailed. We will identify and prioritize more specific risks later in the survey.</p></div>
