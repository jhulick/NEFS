This week:
- Replace as many JSPs as possible by using the cmd to define the content and PATH_INFO to define the navigation.
- Clean up may JSPs that are not being in used.  Both the files as well as references to it in the XML files.
- Create a value source that will be used in dialogs and reports to obtain the URL based on a page id
- Implement that value source throughout the entire application
- Develop the component cmd to be used within the structure.xml (Not sure if this will be finished by this week, but will attempt)
- Integrate the newly developed component cmd to eliminate even more JSPs (Not sure if this will be finished by this week, but will attempt)

Future:
- Look into a third party XML generator to generate test data based on the schema XMLs
- Look at migrating the Artifact_Keyword's keyword to the text-set data type
