    <table name="Claim" abbrev="Clm" type="Default">
        <description>
			This table stores links to all the information required to file a claim with an insurance company.
			It must be remembered that this information will always remain current, therefore the links to that
			information will always reflect the most recent versions of it.  This is fine as long as the claim
			has not been submitted.  As soon as a claim is submitted, all linked information that is relevant
			to the claim is pulled from the appropriate tables and stored in a separate table as a snapshot of
			the data as it was when this particular claim was submitted.  Thus while you can look at the data
			in this table as reflecting valid data for an unsubmitted claim, you cannot do the same for a claim
			that is already submitted.  To get the data that this table was pointing to *when the claim was
			submitted*, you need to look at a different table, to be specified later.

			procedure will therefore have to be related to this diagnosis.  That relationship, however, will
			not be created here in the interests of more normalization.

            &lt;p&gt;Similarly, when a physician responds to two diagnoses on the same claim with one procedure, that
