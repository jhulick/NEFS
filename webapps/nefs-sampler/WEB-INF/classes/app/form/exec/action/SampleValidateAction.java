/**
 * Sample bean that demonstrates how to perform an action after a dialog has accepted data entry. The "action" dialog
 * type will automatically figure out what the Action class needs by way of the constructor, what the execute method
 * signature is, and if there is any validation method available. The primary benefit of an action class like this is
 * that it is a "normal" java bean and does not need to have any imports from com.netspective.* packages unless the
 * programmer desires it. When no reference is made to the Sparx container classes or to any Servlet packages then the
 * action dialog may be easier to unit test as an independent piece of business logic.
 *
 * Constructors may be of the following form:
 *     SampleValidateAction() -- default constructor
 *
 * If any of the following setXXX() methods are found, they will be called automatically to provide active values
 *     setActionDialogContext(ActionDialogContext) -- action class will be provided the active dialog context
 *     setServletEnvironment(Servlet, ServletRequest, ServletResponse) -- action class will be provided the active servlet
 *     setConnectionContext(ConnectionContext) -- if the action needs access to a connection context (in transaction mode)
 *     setConnection(Connection) -- if the action needs access to a JDBC connection (in transaction mode)
 *     * if either setConnectionContext or setConnection are found, an optional getDataSourceId() may be provided by the
 *       action class to supply the data source id for the connection that should be set
 *     * when a connection is provided (either using ConnectionContext or Connection) then the framework is responsible
 *       for closing it -- but, the programmer is reponsible for commit and rollback of the transaction
 *
 * Execute method (the method may have any name, "execute" is default) may be of the following form:
 *     public void execute(Writer) -- provides access to the output stream to be written to, no redirect required
 *     public String execute(Writer) -- provides access to the output stream to be written to, allows for redirect
 *     public void execute() -- an action will be performed and the navigation page will handle the redirect (no writer needed)
 *     public String execute() -- an action will be performed and the return value is either a string or a value source
 *                                spec telling the framework the next action. because the return value will be checked for
 *                                ':' you will need to escape ':' as '\:' when ':' is part of the return value.
 *
 * Validate method (may have any name, but "isValid" is the default) may be of the following form:
 *     public boolean isValid() -- call will be made and if false is returned a standard message will be displayed
 *     public boolean isValid(List) -- call will be made and if false programmer can supply messages by adding to list
