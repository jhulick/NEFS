        1. In Phase I trials, researchers test a new drug or treatment in a small group of people (20-80) for the
        first time to evaluate its safety, determine a safe dosage range, and identify side effects
        2. In Phase II trials, the study drug or treatment is given to a larger group of people (100-300) to see if it
        is effective and to further evaluate its safety.
        3. In Phase III trials, the study drug or treatment is given to large groups of people (1,000-3,000) to confirm
        its effectiveness, monitor side effects, compare it to commonly used treatments, and collect information that
        will allow the drug or treatment to be used safely.
        4. In Phase IV trials, post marketing studies delineate additional information including the drugs risks, benefits,
        and optimal use.

        1. Treatment trials test new treatments, new combinations of drugs, or new approaches to surgery or radiation therapy.
        2. Prevention trials look for better ways to prevent disease in people who have never had the disease or to
        prevent a disease from returning. These approaches may include medicines, vitamins, vaccines, minerals, or lifestyle changes.
        3. Diagnostic trials are conducted to find better tests or procedures for diagnosing a particular disease or condition.
        4. Screening trials test the best way to detect certain diseases or health conditions.
        5. Quality of Life trials (or Supportive Care trials) explore ways to improve comfort and the quality of life
        for individuals with a chronic illness.
