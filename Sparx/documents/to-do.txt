* Add Portlet API implementation for "output" panels (http://www-3.ibm.com/software/webservers/portal/library/InfoCenter/wps/wpspapi.html).

* Add capability for HTTP request parameters to be automatically populate into beans for dialog context liks Struts does
* Add permissions, conditionals, etc into navigation trees
* Add 'forward', 'action', tags to <page> in navigation tree and connect to <director>
* Add 'style-sheet' value source tag to <page>, <report> and other places where XSLT might be useful
* Add sorting to report data source (which should also use cookies to store active sort criteria)
* Allow documentation panels in console which borrow ideas form Sparx 2.0 documentation (XSL, etc)
* Add <panel-type>, <page-type> and other style page templates
* Look at Struts' MessageResources class for creating and 'rb' (resource-bundle) value source for internationlization
* Add DCB's that can populate actions
* Create demo Sparx using CD manager example in Sue Spielman's Struts book -- maybe other e.g.'s like that?
* Add getNavigationContext() as a member of ReportContext and DialogContext -- may return null if not using navigator
* Allow navigation trees and other tags to be "open" -- meaning if they're defined more than once their definitions are extended not replaced.
* Use XDoclet for generating TLD files -- using appropriate merge points.
* Consider using XDoclet for generation of DTD files and XSDs.
* Consider adding struts-style plugins?
