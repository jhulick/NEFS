Sparx Dialogs have the built-in capability to bind and display popup windows 
that can elicit extra information from an end-user and populate a field. 
This type of functionality becomes very useful when a combo box or list box 
is not appropriate for requesting data from a list of choices when the the 
list of choices is very long. For example, when asking for a patient ID from 
a medical database that might be large, a popup window can be implemented that 
allows for searching in the popup window and then when a selection is made 
it is filled into the calling window's control.
