Sparx helps build all aspects of your application's presentation (user interface) layer. Whether building a portal,
a content-management system, or any other type of business application, Sparx provides user interface components
that allow you to focus on your business requirements while it performs navigation, application control, and forms
managment. Even though Sparx allows you to offload almost all user interface tasks onto the framework, you still
have complete control over the look and feel (colors, placement, etc) of your application through skins and themes.
