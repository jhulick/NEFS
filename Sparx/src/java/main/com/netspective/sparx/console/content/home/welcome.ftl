    Welcome to the Netspective Enterprise Console for your web application.
    The Console is a Sparx servlet that provides a browser-based administrative interface to all of the dynamic
    Netspective Enterprise Frameworks Suite (NEFS) components and objects associated with your application. The Console is
    automatically available to all NEFS-based applications during development and can be optionally turned off in
    production (for security).
