The Forms management package allows programmers to declare HTML forms and let Sparx render all of the HTML.
Sparx refers to HTML forms as "Dialogs" because it handles the two-way interaction between browsers and users
completely; this includes data persistence, data validation, a sophisticated client-side Javascript library and user
interface skins. Dialogs can be defined completely in XML, completely in Java, or a combination of the two.
Even in XML, the entire Dialog including labels, captions, validation logic, conditional displays, and other advanced
UI features can be easily defined. By keeping the entire definition in XML, non-programmers or junior engineers can
create forms and more experienced developers can attach business logic as appropriate.
