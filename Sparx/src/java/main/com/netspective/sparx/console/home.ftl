    Welcome to the Netspective Enterprise Console for your application (<code>${vc.servletContext.servletContextName}</code>).

    The Console is a Sparx servlet that provides a browser-based administrative interface to all of the Sparx dynamic
    components and objects associated with your application. The Console is automatically available to all Sparx-based
    applications during development and can be optionally turned off in production (for security).
    <p>
    Your application is using the following RuntimeEnvironmentFlags: <font color=red><code>${vc.environmentFlags}</code></font>.
