The Data Sources package provides powerful database connection and aggregation services. Starting with a simple
interface to one or more database connection and pooling engines and including such features as dynamic data source
definitions and selection, the database connectivity support sets the stage for both static and dynamic SQL libraries
and pooled/cached result sets.
