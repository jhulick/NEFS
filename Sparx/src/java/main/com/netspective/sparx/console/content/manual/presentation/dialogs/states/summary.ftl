 As a user enters data, values persist through pages because Sparx dialogs automatically 
 contain a finite state machine that manages the complete state of dialogs through 
 multiple request/response cycles. This is especially useful for HTTP stateless 
 programming where reporting errors requires pages to be redrawn. Data Persistance 
 allows developers to refresh pages and have data automatically filled into controls 
 regardless of how many times a page is re-displayed to get valid user data.
