The Data Management module provides documentation, statistics, and unit tests for database components such as
static SQL queries, dynamic SQL queries, schemas (database structures), data sources, and database policies.
This SQL framework, called Netspective Axiom, is fully integrated into Sparx and its purpose is to abstract database
access code out of the important business logic layer so that the SQL does not get in the way. The framework also
prevents security problems caused by SQL injection and keeps the SQL malleable by allowing it to change without
recompiling code.
