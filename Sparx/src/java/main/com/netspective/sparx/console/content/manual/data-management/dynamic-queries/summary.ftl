The Dynamic Queries package (also known as the <i>Query Definitions</i> package) allows you to define tables, columns, joins, sort orders, and
other important data through the use of Meta Information about data relationships. Once you create a query
definition, Sparx allows end-users of your application to use simple HTML-based forms to automatically generate
accurate SQL and performance-tuned statements to create paged reports or export data to external sources with very
little effort. Instead of defining dynamic queries using imperative (if/then/else) Java programming using SQL injection,
you simply provide rules to Sparx and then the end-user can generate SQL automatically by simply filling in some query
by example forms.
