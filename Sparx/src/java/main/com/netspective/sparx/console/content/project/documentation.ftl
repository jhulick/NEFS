    The <i>Sparx Project Source</i> is the single entry point for Sparx component declarations.
    Sparx class and instance declarations are performed using XML -- all dialogs, fields,
    validation rules, some conditional processing, all static SQL statements, dynamic queries, database schemas,
    schema data declarations, configuration files, and many other resources may be stored in XML files that are
    re-usable across applications. Although XML is the preferred method for creating resource descritors, everything that
    can be declared in XML can also be coded using the Sparx Java APIs.
    <p>
    Your application's Sparx Project Input Source is <a href="project/input-source"><@projectFile/></a>.
