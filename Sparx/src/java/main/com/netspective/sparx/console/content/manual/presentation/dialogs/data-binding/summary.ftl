Using Value Sources, Sparx provides automatic SQL, a web service, or other data 
binding to any list controls in HTML or DHTML. This allows, for instance a query 
to be run and automatically create text fields, a list box, radio buttons, 
check boxes, and multi-select list boxes. All dialog fields have this dynamic
data binding capability so that arbitrary data sources can populate dialog
contents and selections.
