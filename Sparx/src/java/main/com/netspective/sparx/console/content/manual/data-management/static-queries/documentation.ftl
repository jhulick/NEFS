<h1>Customization</h1>
There are numerous customization and configuration options available for each SQL statement. Each query can supply
alternate SQL for different databases (e.g. one SQL fragment for Oracle versus another for SQL*Server). Also, each
query can act as a template for SQL injection (which can rewrite the query based on value sources).

<h1>Data Sources</h1>
Each SQL statement can specify either no data source (meaning the data comes from the default data
source), a static data source, or a dynamic data source (meaning the data comes from a source that will be determined
automatically based on some rule).
