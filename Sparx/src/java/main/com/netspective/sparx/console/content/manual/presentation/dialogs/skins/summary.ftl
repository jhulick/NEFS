 Sparx separates presentation from forms design and logic by automatically 
 creating all HTML and DHTML in user-extensible "skin" objects. The skins 
 perform all drawing operations while the forms objects manage all of the 
 fields and validation. One immediate benefit of skins is the ability to 
 design and describe a dialog once and exectute it on mobile, small form- 
 factors (handhelds), notebooks, and desktops.
