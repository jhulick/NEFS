Sparx supports the notion of environments like Development, Testing, and Production. When in development environment,
XML-based resource files like dialogs, schemas, SQL, and others are automatically reloaded. In Testing and
Production environments automatic reloading is not enabled. Your applications can use the environment setting to make
appropriate decisions about data sources and other environment-specific settings.
