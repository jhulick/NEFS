Sparx dialogs automatically understand and process common dialog data <i>perspectives</i>
such add, edit, delete, print, and confirm. With these common perspectives and
the ability to have declarative conditionals, fields can appear/disappear
based on dialog data perspectives and population of fields can be made to happen on
only when specific perspectives are encountered. Perspectives can be hard-coded in
the dialogs or may be specified in URLs for added flexibility. Using a single
dialog XML specification and appropriate use of perspectives, significant amounts
of code can be reduced because the same dialogs code can handle all adding, updating,
and deleting of complex data.
