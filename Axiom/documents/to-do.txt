* Add "description" column to enumerations so that each row can contain documentation on itself.
* Add column, table, abbrev validations in collections so that duplicated abbreviations and names are not allowed.
* Add relationship descriptions to foreign keys like they are defined in "Universal Data Models" -- this will allow better DBDDs.
* Add support for validation of "exclusive arcs" where only one of a set of columns should have data (mutually exlusive column values).
* Change 'self-ref' nomenclature to 'recursive-ref'?
* Add java triggers to foreign keys declarations so that onadd/onupdate/etc runs whenever the referenced value changes.
* Add Jakarta DBCP connection pooling as another ConnectionProvider.
* Add flag to Query class that would allow usage of normal Statements instead of prepared statements.
* Allow <query> tags to be added under <schema> that would simply allow the <schema> to act as a namespace.
* Add result set iterator (paging) base classes from Sparx.
* In schema manager, improve automatically generated table Query Definitions with more features such a foreign key references, parent references, etc.
* Complete optimistic locking of an object/row using a Timestamp or Integer column. When conflicts occur, throw an ObjectHasChanged exception.
* Add timeouts and auto-refresh logic to DAL objects so that Rows can re-read themselves after a period of time (useful for caching data).
* Try and catch required, maxlength, and other DAL exceptions prior to the values getting to the JDBC driver (add additional validation rules).
* Add column-level or row-level encryption and support for searching encrypted columns.
* Allow inserts/updates/deletes to use Rows as well as Row so that multiple records can be built into rows and then inserted/updated at once.
* Add support for "Axiom Auto-inc" column where column key value is generated using the design pattern in Java Enterprise Best Practices.
* Allow self-ref foreign keys to generate DAL code that would load a complete hierarchy.
* Add listener support to queries so that methods are called before/after running (to allow other apps to "watch" queries).
* Add ACLs in queries, query-defs, schemas, and DAL.
* Add DAL-style java class generation for static queries.
* Create pluggable cacheable ResultSets with configurable timeouts.
* Add SchemaDoc totals (tables, columns, etc) to the application Metrics.
* Come up with a better name for SchemaDoc and stick to it.
* For each getXXXByYYY() method add an existsXXXWithYYY() method to check for simple existence.
* Add more features to the bulk upload/download via XML (like updates/deletes, exporting to XML, etc).
* Add Supertype/Subtype tables like http://jrf.sourceforge.net/advancedTopics.html#SubtypeTables.
* Add Linking of related objects at retrieval time through the use of a postFind() method. This will be a "find" trigger analogous to insert/update/delete triggers.
* Add validation listeners that can augment validation system.
* Review jRelationalFramework (http://jrf.sourceforge.net/) and Alzabo (http://alzabo.sourceforge.net/) for new DAL features.
* Review http://java.sun.com/blueprints/patterns/DAO.html to consider other items needed by a DAO.
* Review http://db.apache.org/ojb/index.html to see if OJB has any applicability to Axiom.
* Add feature to maintain object identity (multiple lookups on a given table with same primary key should return one and the same object)
